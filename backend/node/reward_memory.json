    "answer": "It appears that you're looking for a recipe for \"Allo ki Sabji,\" which seems to be a variation of a popular Indian dish. However, the provided context doesn't specifically mention \"Ramesh Verma\" or his recipe for \"Allo ki Sabji.\" \n\nGiven the information available, it's possible that \"Allo ki Sabji\" could be similar to a potato-based dish, as \"allo\" might be a colloquial or regional term for potatoes. The context does provide a recipe for \"Gobhi Aloo Matar Sabji\" which includes potatoes, but it's by Mahek Naaz, not Ramesh Verma. \n\nIf you're looking for a potato-based recipe, you might consider using 2 large potatoes, along with other ingredients like cauliflower, green peas, and spices, which are part of the \"Gobhi Aloo Matar Sabji\" recipe mentioned in the context. Nevertheless, without specific details on \"Ramesh Verma's Allo ki Sabji recipe,\" it's challenging to provide an exact recipe.",
