DRL Team AI R&D Center 14 Jan 2025 18 min read Content Intro Types and Applications of Reinforcement Learning by Industry Reinforcement Learning Innovation Landscape VC funding of RL Startups M&A activity in RL Remaining Challenges Introduction Machine Learning broadly encompasses three categories: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of ML in which an agent learns how to make decisions by interacting with an environment to achieve a specific goal. It replicates the trial-and-error learning process humans use to accomplish their goals. The agent's objective is to maximize a cumulative reward over time. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on a training dataset but learns from feedback that evaluates performance without predefined behavioral targets. This dynamic learning process has enabled RL to excel in areas requiring sequential decision-making, from robotics to financial modeling. In essence, RL enables the creation of intelligent agents, which are computer programs capable of making decisions. Reinforcement learning, similar to how humans learn, is especially effective in uncertain and complex environments. The global market for RL technologies, is growing rapidly. In fact, according to industry reports , it was over $52B in 2024 and is projected to reach $32T by 2037, growing at around 65%+ CAGR during 2025 – 2037. In 2025 the industry size of RL is assessed at $122+B. Its applications span robotics, autonomous vehicles, supply chain optimization, healthcare, and gaming, with use cases expanding as the technology matures. Types and Applications of Reinforcement Learning by Industry RL is broadly categorized into three main types: value-based, policy-based, and model-based methods. Value-based approaches, such as Q-learning, focus on estimating the value of actions to determine the best policy indirectly. Policy-based methods, like Policy Gradient, directly optimize the policy itself, making them suitable for high-dimensional action spaces. Model-based RL incorporates an internal model of the environment, enabling agents to plan and simulate outcomes before acting. These diverse methodologies equip RL with the flexibility to tackle a wide range of real-world problems. For instance, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has advanced the field by integrating deep learning techniques with RL algorithms. Leveraging the representational power of neural networks, DRL allows agents to process high-dimensional input data, such as images and complex sensor readings. Techniques like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have demonstrated exceptional performance in environments as varied as video games and autonomous driving. Prominent companies are already leveraging RL to power products and services. To give you some examples of RL applications already available today: Tesla employs RL in its autopilot system to enable real-time decision-making for autonomous vehicles. SpaceX has used RL to improve the precision of rocket landings, a critical component of its reusable rocket technology. A SpaceX Super Heavy booster rocket successfully returned to Earth and was caught by giant robotic arms, marking the first attempt to recover the 232-foot booster at the launch tower after supporting the reusable Starship spacecraft's launch. In gaming, companies like DeepMind have utilized RL to create AI agents that outperform human players in complex games like StarCraft II. ChatGPT uses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align its responses with user preferences. After pretraining on vast datasets, RLHF refines the model by leveraging human feedback to train a reward model and optimize response quality through reinforcement learning techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Your smart robot vacuum avoids obstacles by receiving feedback from its environment and adapting its behavior to prevent collisions with walls, furniture, or stairs. These examples underscore RL's impact, positioning it at the heart of future technological progress. Rising stars that use RL to power their products Based on public information gathered from Crunchbase, Pitchbook, and other open sources, we have compiled a list of venture-backed startups that leverage RL to transform their respective industries with ultimately innovative products. Check out the innovative companies that constitute today's Innovation Landscape in AI in Reinforcement Learning in early 2025.

However, further advancements in RL for energy management face limitations due to a lack of high-quality simulations that accurately reflect real-world scenarios constrains the ability to test and refine RL models comprehensively. Agriculture In Agriculture , RL is optimizing resource use, improving crop yields, and automating tasks. Research suggests RL can help manage water and fertilizer use more efficiently, detect pests and diseases using drones, and optimize planting patterns to enhance productivity. For example, RL-powered drones have been trained to adjust their velocity and height to apply precise amounts of pesticides. There is also exploration of RL-driven robots capable of harvesting crops like apples or pruning grapevines, although these technologies remain largely experimental with limited commercial use. Reinforcement learning-based Digital Twin applications for each category A typical RL workflow in Agriculture involves collecting data, creating a digital twin, training RL models in simulated environments, and deploying them in the real world. However, the absence of mature digital twin systems specific to agriculture is a major challenge. Current efforts are focused on building these simulations to enable RL applications, such as greenhouse energy management. Despite the potential, decision-making systems for plant care are still in the research phase due to limited data and the high cost of errors. While RL shows significant promise in advancing agricultural efficiency and sustainability, practical implementation remains constrained by technological and data limitations. Greeneye Technology , for example, utilizes AI and deep learning to revolutionize agricultural pest control by enabling precise, selective spraying of herbicides. Their proprietary Selective Spraying (SSP) system integrates seamlessly with existing agricultural sprayers, allowing real-time identification and targeted application to weeds, which can reduce herbicide usage by up to 90%. This approach enhances crop management efficiency, reduces environmental impact, and increases profitability for farmers. Taranis employs advanced AI and machine learning techniques to provide high-resolution, leaf-level imagery and actionable insights for crop management. Their platform captures detailed images of crops, enabling the detection of issues such as diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies. While Taranis utilizes sophisticated AI and machine learning algorithms, there is no explicit information indicating the use of reinforcement learning in their agricultural solutions. Manufacturing Additionally, RL is making strides in Manufacturing, i.e. in automated design and experimentation. Quilter employs RL for automating printed circuit board (PCB) designs, streamlining production in electronics manufacturing. In quantum physics, companies like Qruise integrate RL to create digital twins that assist researchers in experiments, helping uncover the parameters of quantum devices. These advancements highlight RL's versatility, from logistics to complex scientific research, underscoring its transformative potential across industries. Quilter uses reinforcement learning informed by physics simulations to create a fully automated, superhuman circuit board designer Biotech In Biotech , RL has the potential to address critical challenges, such as workforce shortages in healthcare and the unpredictability of biotech research. Two primary use cases have emerged: dynamic treatment regimes and drug discovery assistance. While the first application, dynamic treatment regimes, is still poorly defined and underexplored among startups, existing research suggests RL could help optimize personalized treatment plans over time (e.g., through mathematical methods as discussed in referenced papers). However, the complexity of medical decision-making and limited understanding of the field poses challenges to broader adoption. The second use case, drug discovery assistance, has gained more traction, with companies like Biomonadic , Ordaos , and Isomorphic Labs leading the way. These firms focus on software that accelerates and improves drug research processes. For example, Biomonadic and Ordaos specialize in optimizing research related to mini-proteins and plasmids, enhancing both speed and efficiency. Isomorphic Labs, supported by Alphabet and employing a sizable team of 164 professionals, is less explicit about its specific contributions but shows promise in pushing innovation forward. RL in biotech is helping to enhance research reliability, streamline processes, and potentially revolutionize drug discovery. Fintech In Fintech, RL is primarily applied to stock market prediction and high-frequency trading (HFT), although its efficacy and limitations spark skepticism. Most current RL-based solutions focus on short-term trading optimizations rather than long-term value investing. Notable examples include AI Capital Management , a hedge fund leveraging RL for HFT, and Equilibre Technologies , which combines RL with game theory for algorithmic trading. Equilibre's team, consisting of former Google DeepMind professionals, recently raised $7 million in funding, signaling credibility and potential for future innovation despite limited public details about their work. Another interesting application of RL in fintech involves optimizing venture capital investments. Recent research introduced an RL agent designed to predict investment amounts in startups based on specific factors. While the model outperforms existing alternatives, the dataset's quality and evaluation metrics remain limitations. Researchers acknowledge that financial performance data of portfolio companies is absent, hindering predictive accuracy. Plans for future work include integrating richer datasets and refining evaluation metrics to better assess fund allocation. This underscores RL's potential in fintech and also highlights the need for robust data and methodological improvements for effective deployment. Alpha VC RL-based Model Framework Game Development RL's role in Gaming is as a training ground for models and as a tool for game development. RL has powered breakthroughs in complex games, such as AlphaGo, OpenAI Five (DOTA2), and AlphaStar (StarCraft II), showcasing its ability to handle intricate strategies and dynamics. In game development, RL is used to create adaptive non-player characters (NPCs) and dynamic environments, with companies like rct AI leading in this space. Additionally, RL supports innovations in animation generation, such as Latent Technology's pre-seed efforts, and emerging areas like text-to-3D model creation, as seen with Irreverent Labs . Education RL is being explored in Education for applications like personalizing curricula, providing adaptive hints and quizzes, and optimizing A/B testing in educational platforms. RL is also used to model human students and generate educational content. However, these efforts face significant challenges, including unreliable and limited datasets, as well as uncertainties about the appropriate level of personalization for each student. There are also concerns about bias in the design of RL agents and the potential unintended consequences of their recommendations. While the technology remains in its infancy with no major startups yet, it holds promise for creating highly adaptive and tailored educational experiences in the future. Healthcare RL in healthcare enables the development of dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) for chronic conditions, allowing providers to deliver tailored, adaptive interventions that improve patient outcomes. RL also enhances operational efficiency, optimizing resource allocation, scheduling, and workflow in hospitals while reducing costs. In drug discovery, RL accelerates the identification of effective compounds and predicts drug responses, saving time and resources. RL excels in handling uncertainty and complexity, making it invaluable for predicting disease progression and selecting optimal treatments in critical care. By learning from data and outcomes, RL systems refine their strategies to enhance accuracy and reliability, supporting decision-making where traditional methods fall short. Ordaōs utilizes reinforcement learning within its proprietary Design Engine to create de novo mini-proteins, known as miniPRO™, for therapeutic applications. This approach enables the rapid and efficient design of bespoke proteins that are more configurable, stable, and easier to manufacture than traditional antibodies, thereby accelerating the development of safer and more effective treatments. Ordaos miniPRO™ UnityAI employs reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance hospital operations by optimizing patient flow and resource allocation. Their AI-driven platform analyzes real-time data to recommend actions that improve efficiency and patient care. Despite its potential, RL faces challenges like data scarcity, as ethical concerns and privacy regulations limit access to real patient data, requiring simulated environments or historical datasets. Additionally, human physiology's complexity leads to partial observability, complicating decision-making. Effective application of RL depends on improving data availability, creating accurate simulations, and designing reward structures that balance short- and long-term health outcomes. Marketing In Marketing , RL can enhance strategies by enabling dynamic decision-making that adapts to consumer interactions in real-time. RL algorithms can personalize content delivery by analyzing individual customer behaviors and preferences, ensuring that marketing messages align closely with consumer interests.

Remaining Challenges Despite its huge potential, Reinforcement Learning is still nascent in its progress and potential. Below, we summarize some of the challenges that hinder RL from deeper penetration and impact: Data Scarcity and Quality: RL requires substantial amounts of high-quality data for effective training. In many fields, acquiring real-world data is still challenging due to ethical concerns, privacy regulations, skills, or cost. High Computational Costs: RL algorithms are computationally intensive, especially when simulating complex environments or processing high-dimensional data. Meta, for example, owns over 350,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its computing power while most businesses might struggle to obtain a few. Reward Design Complexity: Designing appropriate reward structures that guide the agent effectively is difficult, particularly when balancing short-term and long-term goals. Part of the answer could be in leveraging hierarchical RL and multi-objective optimization to design reward mechanisms that align with complex, real-world objectives. Generalization Issues: RL models often struggle to generalize well to unseen environments or variations in real-world applications. Lack of Explainability: RL models can function as \"black boxes,\" making it hard to explain their decisions, a significant concern in fields like healthcare and autonomous systems. This especially could be an issue in sensitive sectors like healthcare or defense. Developing methods to make RL algorithms interpretable, such as visualizing decision processes or integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques could be part of the solution. Safety and Ethical Concerns: In critical applications like healthcare or autonomous driving, ensuring safety while the agent explores new strategies is a significant challenge. Implementing robust policies for ethical use, and addressing privacy, fairness, and safety concerns in sensitive applications can help alleviate some of these concerns.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of what reinforcement learning is, its origins, how it compares to other AI approaches, its leading proponents, and why it continues to be a research hotspot. Press enter or click to view image in full size Photo by Nice M Nshuti on Unsplash ⸻ What Is Reinforcement Learning? Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions to maximize a cumulative reward signal over time. Unlike supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data, RL learns from trial and error. The process can be framed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and typically involves: •\tState (s): The current situation. •\tAction (a): The decision the agent can make. •\tReward (r): Feedback from the environment based on the action. •\tPolicy (π): A strategy the agent follows. •\tValue function (V): Expected reward from a state. •\tQ-function (Q): Expected reward from a state-action pair. ⸻ Historical Development The foundations of RL date back to early ideas in psychology (e.g., Thorndike’s Law of Effect in 1911) and control theory. Key milestones include: •\t1950s — 70s: Bellman’s Dynamic Programming and early theories of optimal control. •\t1980s: Watkins’ introduction of Q-learning and Sutton’s work on temporal difference learning. •\t1990s — 2000s: RL applied to robotics and basic games; Sutton & Barto publish Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (1998). •\t2013 — 2016: DeepMind’s breakthroughs using deep neural networks (Deep Q-Networks) in Atari games and AlphaGo. ⸻ Relationship to Machine Learning and Deep Learning Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning (ML), which itself is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). When neural networks are used as function approximators in RL (as in Deep Q-Learning or Actor-Critic methods), it becomes a part of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Hierarchy: •\tAI → Broad field of making machines intelligent. •\tMachine Learning (ML) → Learning from data. •\tReinforcement Learning (RL) → Learning through interaction and feedback. •\tDeep Learning (DL) → Learning through multi-layered neural networks. •\tDeep RL → Uses DL techniques to scale RL. ⸻ Applications of Reinforcement Learning RL is well-suited for problems involving sequential decision-making. Major application domains include: •\tGaming and Simulation: AlphaGo, AlphaStar (StarCraft), OpenAI Five (Dota 2). •\tRobotics: Locomotion, manipulation, and autonomous navigation. •\tFinance: Portfolio optimization and algorithmic trading. •\tHealthcare: Treatment recommendation and adaptive dosing. •\tIndustrial Control: Energy optimization in data centers and smart grids. •\tAutonomous Vehicles: Path planning and adaptive cruise control. •\tOperations Research: Supply chain management and warehouse logistics. ⸻ Market Penetration: What Share of AI Is RL? Despite its prominence in research, reinforcement learning constitutes a small fraction of real-world AI applications. Estimates in 2025 suggest less than 5% of deployed AI systems rely on RL, with most commercial systems still dominated by supervised and unsupervised learning. However, RL’s share is growing in sectors requiring real-time, adaptive decision-making. ⸻ Leading Companies and Research Labs Some of the most influential players in RL include: •\tDeepMind (Alphabet): Pioneers in deep RL, creators of AlphaGo, MuZero, and Gato. •\tOpenAI: Developed OpenAI Five and influential in safe exploration and generalist agents. •\tMeta AI: Known for multi-agent systems and hierarchical RL. •\tMicrosoft Research & Azure AI: Focused on industrial control and personalization. •\tNVIDIA: Provides simulation environments (Isaac Gym) and GPU-accelerated RL frameworks. •\tAmazon Robotics & AWS: Using RL for warehouse logistics and robotics control. Academic institutions like UC Berkeley (BAIR), Stanford, MIT, and CMU also lead foundational research. ⸻ What Makes Reinforcement Learning Distinct? RL is distinct from other ML paradigms in the following ways: •\tInteraction-based learning: Learns by doing, not just observing. •\tDelayed rewards: Optimizes long-term return, not immediate accuracy. •\tExploration vs. exploitation tradeoff: Must balance trying new actions with using known ones. •\tNon-i.i.d. data: Data distribution changes based on the agent’s behavior. •\tEnvironment-centric: Requires a simulation or real-world interface. These characteristics make RL uniquely suited for real-time control, but also more complex and resource-intensive. ⸻ Key Elements of Machine Learning The three major paradigms of ML are: 1.\tSupervised Learning: Learns from labeled input-output pairs. (e.g., classification, regression) 2.\tUnsupervised Learning: Discovers patterns from unlabeled data. (e.g., clustering, PCA) 3.\tReinforcement Learning: Learns optimal actions via feedback from environment. 4.\t(Emerging) Self-supervised Learning: Learns representations from raw data (e.g., contrastive learning, masked prediction). 5.\tSemi-supervised Learning: Mix of labeled and unlabeled data. ⸻ Main Models Used in RL Some of the foundational and modern RL algorithms include: •\tQ-learning •\tSARSA •\tPolicy Gradient Methods •\tActor-Critic Algorithms •\tProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) •\tSoft Actor-Critic (SAC) •\tDeep Q-Networks (DQN) •\tMuZero (planning without a model of the environment) •\tMulti-Agent RL (MARL) Frameworks used: TensorFlow Agents, Ray RLlib, OpenAI Gym, PyTorch RL, Isaac Gym, CleanRL. ⸻ Seminal Papers in Machine Learning & Reinforcement Learning Some of the most cited and influential papers: General Machine Learning: •\t“A Few Useful Things to Know About Machine Learning” — Pedro Domingos (2012) •\t“ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks” — Krizhevsky et al. (2012) •\t“Attention Is All You Need” — Vaswani et al. (2017) Reinforcement Learning: •\t“Learning from Delayed Rewards” — Chris Watkins (1989) [Q-learning] •\t“Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction” — Sutton & Barto (Book, 1998 / 2018) •\t“Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning” — Mnih et al. (2013) [DQN] •\t“Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search” — Silver et al. (2016) [AlphaGo] •\t“Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms” — Schulman et al. (2017) •\t“Mastering Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi by Planning with a Learned Model” — Schrittwieser et al. (2020) [MuZero] ⸻ Looking Ahead Reinforcement learning in 2025 remains both promising and limited. It dominates AI headlines with demonstrations of high intelligence and autonomy but faces practical hurdles such as sample inefficiency, reward shaping, and real-world safety constraints. Ongoing work on generalist agents (e.g., DeepMind’s Gato or OpenAI’s GPT agents with memory and decision modules) hints at a future where RL fuses with LLMs, robotics, and unsupervised pretraining. As the field matures, reinforcement learning may evolve from niche use to foundational infrastructure in autonomous systems — shaping not just how machines act, but how they adapt, learn, and evolve over Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning Technology Software Development Software Engineering -- -- 1 Written by James Fahey 88 followers · 2 following AI, Innovation, Creativity, and Entrepreneurship Responses ( 1 ) See all responses Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech"

At MobiDev, we identify trends that can deliver benefits now, versus those yet to reach their full potential. In this article, we are going to shed light on the latest trends in machine learning (ML), and how they can drive business growth and provide tangible value. From GenAI creating complex multimedia content to the rise of small language models (SLM) – the trends listed below will be in the headlines a lot in 2025. Trend #1. The rise of generative models for complex content generation Generative models have already altered text-based tools like OpenAI’s GPT models. But, the burgeoning interest in these models is not solely confined to written language. Now they encompass a diverse array of content types, including graphics, video, and music. This shift is expected to further expand at a CAGR of 37.6% from 2025 to 2030, enhancing artistic expression and practical applications. Let’s explore the most prominent examples: 1. GenAI in visual arts One of the great examples is Stable Diffusion which reached significant advancement in text-to-image synthesis. Unlike traditional diffusion models that work in image space, this tool operates in a compressed latent space, allowing for a more efficient generation of high-resolution images. Another noteworthy tool is Muse, created by the tech giant Google. It acts as a collaborative partner for artists augmenting their creative workflow. Imagen, another GenAI model from Google, focuses on photorealistic imagery. Utilizing a combination of advanced diffusion processes, Imagen translates textual descriptions into strikingly realistic images. 2. GenAI in video production Models like Synthesia and Runway ML are leading the charge. Synthesia allows artists to create realistic AI-generated videos with lifelike avatars interpreting content in multiple languages. The scope of implications this tech enables is immense. This is particularly true in fields like education, marketing, and entertainment, where personalized video content is generally produced on a massive scale. Another great example is Runway ML. With its help, creators can manipulate video elements while streaming, delivering real-time editing and effects that were once the domain of high-budget productions. 3. GenAI in the music industry Tools like Nvidia’s Fugatto and Fluxmusic help compose original music across various genres and styles via a prompt. Fugatto employs a “style transfer” method to assimilate and blend characteristics from different musical styles. It can thus create unique new pieces that reflect the intricacies of original genres. This capability offers composers a space for experimentation. Fluxmusic is another innovative player in the realm of AI-driven music generation, focusing on the fluidity and adaptability of musical creation. This model stands out for its emphasis on real-time interaction, designed to create ambient and generative soundscapes. This feature makes the tool perfect for composers working with film, gaming, and therapy, where atmosphere and mood are paramount. However, we should stay vigilant about the ethical and societal impact of how we use generative models. Concerns regarding copyright, authenticity, and misuse arise and must be addressed. It’s worth remembering that technologies should serve as tools for enhancement rather than disruption. How to implement this trend Identify the user needs for AI-generated content Determine the resource limitations of your system Identify potential use cases or topics that should not be addressed using the developed approach Develop the model Trend #2. Shifting from LLMs to SLMs The rise of domain-specific language models has inspired a key realization — when it comes to model size, bigger isn’t always better. Although large language models (LLMs) have fueled GenAI, they still pose significant constraints. Training and deploying models on hundreds of billions of parameters requires enormous financial resources and server infrastructure. This is something only a handful of tech giants can afford. Further, researchers at the University of Washington state that a typical day of ChatGPT usage can match the daily energy consumption of 33,000 U.S. households . Smaller language models (SLMs) present a sustainable alternative. They deliver impressive outcomes with a much less resource-intensive effort. For example, Qwen is a lightweight SLM that can run effectively on devices with limited processing power. This facilitates the integration of ML in everyday technologies, from mobile apps to IoT devices. Another good example is Pythia, built to facilitate research and experimentation in the field of NLP. Its architecture incorporates a variety of components that can be independently modified. Hence, researchers can tailor the model to specific tasks or datasets. Research shows that smaller models trained on larger, more diverse datasets often outperform larger counterparts trained on limited data. This has pushed the trend of maximizing output with fewer parameters. What other merits do SMLs possess? Smaller models require less hardware to operate, making them cost-effective. This paves the way for a broader range of individuals and organizations to play their part in ML development and usage. As smaller enterprises, with fewer educators, and researchers — these models empower diverse communities to innovate and improve existing systems. SLMs open up possibilities for applications like edge computing and IoT (Internet of Things). Running models on smaller devices, such as a smartphone or laptop, boosts performance in decentralized scenarios. In addition, without the need to send sensitive data to external servers, users gain greater control over their data security. The smaller the model, the easier it is to trace and understand how it makes decisions. LLMs are immensely complex, often operating as “black boxes,” making it challenging to pinpoint the reasoning behind outputs. This is where technology trust issues take root. Explainability is critical for building trustworthy systems that operate transparently and are amenable to continuous improvement. How to implement this trend Identify resource and time limitations Select an SLM model that aligns with these limitations Train the model and identify topics where it exhibits hallucination Deploy the model Trend #3. GPUs for accelerated model training Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) form the backbone of machine learning training due to their speed and efficiency. Advanced GPUs process datasets and train complex models even faster than traditional CPUs. They use sequential computing, processing one prompt at a time requiring each task to be fulfilled before proceeding to the next. Why GPUs are essential? GPUs can handle simultaneous operations, which is necessary for large-scale ML tasks. Also, for businesses reliant on ML, GPUs can help cut down training times and cloud computing expenses. Cloud-based GPU solutions are now available on the market. So businesses can decide between GPU on-premise or cloud depending on scalability needs. We feel it’s important to note here that rising cloud computing costs overlap with declining hardware availability (this is another reason for the shift toward smaller models driven by both necessity and ambitious business goals). Hardware shortage has put significant pressure on the industry to ramp up GPU production. It also unveiled the need to develop more affordable and efficient hardware solutions, which are simpler to manufacture and deploy. As of today, much of the computational burden rests with cloud providers. Since hardware shortages add more challenges and expenses to on-premise server setups, cloud providers should get ready to revamp and optimize their systems to meet the growing demands of GenAI. How to implement this trend Determine the compute resources required for model training Set up the GPU machine Prepare the AI model for training Train and deploy the model Trend #4. Optimized computing for better model performance Edge computing is a key in distributed computing frameworks, accelerating processing speeds and enabling real-time analysis. This approach reduces bandwidth use and latency. With these two parameters minimized, data is better optimized to be transferred to centralized systems for further processing. Tools like Google Cloud platforms, prove the capabilities of edge computing by making remote workspaces more efficient. Edge ML is ensuring resiliency across industries. Here’s how: In healthcare: ML-based wearable devices deliver real-time insights into patient’s essential health indicators (blood pressure, heart rate, etc.) paving the way for early medical interventions. In autonomous vehicles: data collected by edge biometrics technologies (sensor cameras) vehicles adapt to deviating road situations without centralized servers. One notable example is the integration of computing systems within 5G Points of Presence (PoPs), like Verizon’s 5G Edge platform, that boosts vehicle intelligence. In manufacturing: machines equipped with advanced analytics help identify potential malfunctions, and with predictive maintenance , schedule necessary repairs before issues escalate. This minimizes downtime and lowers operational costs. In retail: technologies like smart shelves help retailers monitor product stock accurately. They then help optimize store layouts facilitating store workers’ operational load. However, edge ML can’t handle complex problems without advanced tools. That is why quantum computing is gaining traction in ML. Quantization models available on the Hugging Face platform reduce memory usage and computational demands via lower-precision data types (8-bit integers (int8)) for weights and activations. This way, larger models can fit into memory while accelerating inference processes. While these distinct technologies were designed for different needs, they hold immense potential for collaboration. Merging the computational strength of Quantum Computing with the processing capabilities of Edge Computing, industries can address a broader spectrum of complex scenarios. For instance, quantum algorithms implemented at the edge can deliver real-time insights for informed decision-making. Similarly, the data produced at the edge can train and refine quantum machine learning models, boosting the effectiveness of both technologies. This synergy could facilitate quantum-inspired machine learning forecasts directly at the edge. This would provide near-instant analysis vital for finance, retail, etc. How to implement this trend Identify the need to reduce model size due to resource constraints Select a model size reduction approach, such as quantization Optimize the initial model and deploy it Trend #5. Automated machine learning for speed and cost-cutting AutoML automates critical stages of the data science workflow. It streamlines processes like data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, etc. Users can train models directly from raw data and then deploy these models with just a few clicks. This makes advanced machine learning feasible even for those lacking deep technical knowledge. Why is this trend important? Given the shortage of ML specialists on the market, companies spend a tremendous amount of resources to implement their solutions in real-world scenarios. This is because machine learning pipelines were designed and executed manually by experts. Whether intentionally or not, they created a steep barrier for non-experts. AutoML makes the process simpler for both novices and experienced developers. Note that AutoML doesn’t render data scientists or ML engineers obsolete. Instead, it assists them with task automation within ML pipelines so that they can focus on higher-value activities (interpreting results, fine-tuning models, etc.) By leveraging AutoML, businesses can prioritize growth and innovation rather than spending time on the minutiae of ML model creation and training. AutoML platforms have already proven to be useful in some industries. In agriculture, they facilitate product quality testing processes. In cybersecurity, they monitor data flows for malware, and spam, preventing cyber threats. In entertainment, they optimize content selection and recommendation engines. In marketing, they enhance behavioral marketing campaigns via recommendations and predictive analytics, ultimately improving engagement rates. In retail, they streamline inventory management to cut costs and boost profits. How to implement this trend Ensure your task has no complex dependencies and does not require custom training Develop the approach and monitor its performance to enable timely adjustments Trend #6. Multimodal machine learning Multimodal ML represents a leap forward from traditional single-mode data processing. This technology integrates multiple input types like text, images, and sound. This approach mimics the human ability to process sensory information, opening new doors for interaction and innovation. Here’s a brief outlook of the tasks these models perform: Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Visual Reasoning: VQA employs computer vision to interpret images. Meanwhile, visual reasoning enables the system to infer relationships, compare objects, and understand details from context. Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA): DocVQA equips ML to “read” and interpret documents directly from images. With the help of computer vision and NLP, it extracts specifics about the document’s content and layout. Image Captioning: merging vision and language, it allows for the descriptive interpretation of an image. For instance, it scans a photo and summarizes it as “a sunset over a calm sea” or “a busy marketplace”. This ML can tell stories about the visual world, one picture at a time. Image-Text Retrieval: this task links images to their corresponding descriptions, acting as a search engine that handles visuals and text interchangeably. This technology delivers detailed textual descriptions of images. Visual Grounding: this task links language to specific parts of an image. For instance, when asked, “Where’s an orange in the fruit bowl?” it will identify and highlight the orange. This enables precise connections between visual elements and their linguistic references. Text-to-Image Generation: this method creates images based on written descriptions, ranging from realistic depictions to imaginative abstractions. Basically, multimodal ML processes diverse inputs and produces more informed, nuanced responses. Whether applied in education, transportation, or content generation, it is setting the stage for systems aligned with human needs and complexities. The future of ML lies in its ability to connect modalities, and multimodal systems are leading the way. How to implement this trend Identify the necessity of using multimodal models Ensure your system can support such models within its limitations Implement and deploy the multimodal model Trend #7. Few-shot & zero-shot prompting Few-shot and zero-shot prompting methods leverage LLMs to perform a wide variety of tasks. Since they work with minimal or no task-specific training data, they address challenges in data scarcity and adaptability. Few-shot prompting mechanisms work as follows: the user presents several examples of input-output illustrating the desired behavior. For instance, let’s say a text classification task contains sentences labeled as “positive” or “negative”. The model uses these labeled examples to discern patterns/cues informing about the task. Zero-shot prompting relies on the “understanding” gained from pre-training on data. This method uses natural language instructions instead of specific examples. For instance, it can sort text as “spam” or “not spam” without needing examples of spam emails. Why do these methods matter in real-world applications? Many real-world scenarios lack access to comprehensive, labeled datasets for every likely outcome. These techniques empower models to adapt to new tasks without large-scale data labeling. In fields like healthcare, customer service, and resource management, where new data classes emerge frequently, this approach can be a game-changer. For instance, few-shot learning for imaging helps enhance medical scan analysis speed and robustness. It represents a shift toward versatile ML applications that evolve alongside varying needs. How to implement this trend For prompting: Identify the necessity of few-shot or zero-shot prompting Ensure compatibility with prompting approaches Develop and fine-tune the prompts Test and evaluate Deploy the prompting solution Trend #8. Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning (RL) stands out among machine learning algorithms for its unique approach to learning via interaction. With supervised learning, fixed data guides the process. RL, however, operates in unsupervised environments with limited instruction. This iterative process makes RL adaptable. It can excel not only in gaming, but also in fields like robotics and healthcare. At its core, RL mirrors human traits like evolution and decision-making, altering the way machines learn and interact. Reinforcement learning shines across various industries: In robotics: RL equips robots to function in unstructured settings. They can grasp objects, navigate the environment, and execute complex movements. In finance: RL assists in portfolio management, algorithmic trading, risk assessment, etc. Via rapid data analysis, algorithms forecast market responses helping asset managers adapt to volatile circumstances. In healthcare, RL helps personalize treatments and enhance patient care, and drug discovery. It can tailor care plans based on individual patient data for better treatment outcomes. Another way to train ML is using Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) which uses human input to train a “reward model”. This model is then employed during the RL process to enhance the agent’s performance. RLHF is handy for tasks with objectives that are complex, vague, or challenging for algorithms to define. For instance, defining “funny” in precise mathematical terms is nearly impossible (programmatically). Evaluating and rating jokes created by LLM is easy though. The model converts human feedback into a reward function, which then tells the LLM to improve joke-writing capabilities. The hottest trend in RL so far is fine-tuning large vision-language models (VLMs). Scientists provide a task description and prompt the VLM to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The CoT approach facilitates the exploration of intermediate steps that lead to the desired text-based action. Subsequently, the output is converted into executable actions to interact with the environment which then delivers task-specific rewards. These rewards help fine-tune the entire model through RL. How to implement this trend Identify the necessity of using a reinforcement learning (RL) system for your task Ensure your system has the resources and infrastructure to support RL training and execution Design and implement the RL system, including defining the environment, reward function, and policy structure Train the RL system and evaluate its performance in the target environment Deploy the trained RL system and monitor its performance for necessary adjustments Trend #9. MLOps Despite rapid ML evolution, many data scientists face persistent challenges when building exceptional models. A staggering 80% of these projects never make it to deployment. The thing is that creating a robust ML model is just one aspect of the broader workflow. Without successful deployment, monitoring, and proper maintenance, models fail to achieve their full potential. This is where Machine Learning Operations enter the game. MLOps practices, when incorporated correctly, allow organizations to automate critical aspects of the ML lifecycle, up to post-deployment improvements. This automation simplifies the integration of ML solutions into broader software development pipelines. Here’s how MLOps enhances ML workflows: Automated workflows translate into significant cost savings for strategic resource allocation. Features for tracking data usage, model changes, and access permissions ensure all stakeholders adhere to governance standards. A unified platform for data scientists, software developers, and IT teams to work together facilitates the consistent movement of models from development to production. Every stage of the ML lifecycle, from data preparation to model deployment, is meticulously managed, resulting in better oversight of complex ML projects. Why MLOps is extremely relevant right now? Since forecasts imply the use of machine learning models in production settings will expand, MLOps may just serve as a key driver of this growth. Achieving meaningful results requires more than just sophisticated algorithms. One of the top platforms for managing ML models is MLflow. It provides comprehensive frameworks for experimentation and deployment facilitating reproducibility and scalability for complex ML projects. MLflow consists of four key components: Tracking: users log in and monitor ML training processes (runs) and perform queries using Java, Python, R, or REST APIs Models: a standardized format for packaging and reusing models across environments and pipelines Model Registry: a centralized system for managing models and their lifecycle via organized versioning and governance Projects: packaging the code used in data science tasks for seamless reuse How to implement this trend Identify the need for MLOps by evaluating the complexity of your ML workflows, the frequency of updates, and the scale of deployment. Choose tools and platforms for version control, CI/CD pipelines, model monitoring, and resource management Configure a collaborative environment with version control for code, data, and model artifacts. Develop CI/CD pipelines to automate data preprocessing, model training, testing, and deployment. Deploy tools for monitoring model performance and data drift, and establish feedback loops for continuous improvement. Deploy the finalized pipeline and establish processes for ongoing maintenance and scalability. Trend #10. Low-code/no-code machine learning No-code ML platforms allow users to create models and generate predictions without the need to write code. Traditional ML requires a skilled data scientist and knowledge of programming languages (Python). A data scientist acts as follows: manually prepares data perform feature engineerings allocate a portion of the data for training and tuning deploying the model into a production environment. With the help of no-code platforms, all users, not just data scientists, can design and deploy machine learning models quickly. It’s different from AutoML as well. AutoML facilitates certain processes, like data preparation and algorithm selection. But it still requires expertise from data scientists. No-code ML eliminates the reliance on specialized knowledge. Yes, it does speed up the app development process. But it also has its own set of limitations. Standardized API interactions simplify workflows, but restrict functionality, especially when businesses need custom solutions. Developers may also face difficulties due to the lack of capabilities like automated testing, version control, and code reviews. Ml platforms work well for simple, event-driven tasks while struggling with high data volumes or complex workflows. Integrations based on prebuilt connectors on a low-code/no-code platform are heavily dependent on the platform itself, which risks vendor lock-in. Low-code/no-code platforms often apply a usage-based pricing model, creating unpredictable expenditures. How to implement this trend Ensure your task has no complex dependencies and does not require custom training. Develop the approach and monitor its performance to enable timely adjustments. Trend #11. Retrieval-augmented generation Retrieval-augmented generation acts as a bridge between a user’s input and the LLM output. Instead of relying solely on existing training data, a RAG-supported application retrieves additional, high-quality information. This comes in handy in enterprise settings reliant on precise information. It thus delivers accurate answers and avoids ML hallucinations (false or fabricated outputs). Hallucination happens when a model generates a factually incorrect, irrelevant, or inconsistent output. These inaccuracies arise either because LLMs rely on static training data or fail to understand the user query. RAG, though aimed at this problem, can still encounter similar challenges. It happens when RAG relies solely on unstructured and generalized internal data. For example, an airline chatbot might provide outdated fare details if the augmented data doesn’t include updated payment policies. However, with GenAI Data Fusion, RAG can integrate information from multiple sources (Customer 360, Product 360 data, etc.). This enables the generation of highly accurate and context-specific prompts. One example of this approach is K2View’s data product platform. It enables RAG to stream and unify data from diverse sources via APIs or change data capture (CDC). Businesses thus can deliver personalized and accurate responses across a variety of use cases, ranging from hyper-personalized marketing to fraud monitoring. How to implement this trend Identify the need for an RAG system. Ensure your system supports necessary components like a vector database and language model. Configure the vector database for document indexing and retrieval. Integrate the retriever with the language model. Deploy and monitor the RAG system for performance and accuracy. Trend #12: Ethical and explainable models Debates over whether ML models ensure fairness , accountability, and transparency grow along with the wider usage of this technology. This in turn pushes the trend toward explainable model adoption. Its focus is to create transparent models, allowing users to trust and justify their outputs. Why is this trend important? The rising use of ML models for content generation raises ethical concerns over its ability to generate harmful or biased outputs. Explainable machine learning helps understand how decisions are made, instilling trust into complex systems. Two notable techniques for explaining ML decisions are SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): SHAP framework is based on Shapley values, a method for fair payout distribution among players. In the context of ML, the “players” are the features of the model, and the “payouts” represent the model output. LIME slightly perturbs the input data to observe changes in predictions. It creates a local linear model that can shed light on how complex models make decisions. Explainable machine learning possesses several features that can help ensure responsible use of models: Unlike traditional “black box” ML models, explainable models outline how output decisions were made. Explainable ML helps organizations meet the requirements of regulations (like GDPR) and articulate how automated decisions are reached. Since these models are more transparent, data scientists can better examine their work, pinpoint biases or errors, and validate them with greater accuracy. How to implement this trend Identify the need for explainable AI in your system. Choose appropriate explainability techniques Integrate the techniques into your model pipeline. Test and deploy the explainable AI system Trend #13. Agentic AI With a 44% CAGR, AI Agents market is projected to reach $47.1B in 2030. This alone is a clear signal that many companies are ready to invest in this technology because they see a business value in it. So what are AI Agents? In a nutshell, Agentic AI is a system with AI at its core that can reason, make decisions, and act upon them using tools that are part of this system. AI agents are highly independant and need minimal control and input from humans. Similar to generative AI, agents can be applied in many different areas of business. However, unlike that of gen AI, their primary function is to independently complete multistep tasks. They are great for process automation and optimization of workflow, especially those that require a lot of manual and tedious work. AI Agent use cases include: Smart Chatbots and Voice Assistants that can complete tasks beyond answering simple FAQs. For example, check the availability of an item in a particular location. Predictive Analytics & Anomaly detection: AI Agents can initiate a deeper research from other data bases upon finding anomaly trends in their immediately available data. Procurement: agents can analyze the aveaible stock, historical demand, and current market state, to initiate replenishment request.
